# Bamazon

This application is a demonstration of how to query a database and update its content from a client's perspective. It's a simulation of a basic marketplace where a store has an inventory database that a user can view and attempt to purchase an item from (minus the front end storefront, payment processing, fulfillment, and actual items).

# Instructions

Navigate to the Bamazon directory in your console. Make sure a local sql server is hosting the 'bamazon.db' file. Node dependencies are listed in the 'package.json' file. Recommend installing them before attempting to run bamazonCustomer.js. Open the bamazonCustomer.js file with node. Respond to the prompts as appropriate. If you get confused, please reference the 'Bamazon Demo.mp4' file in this repository for a UX demo. Sorry, but UI sux.
